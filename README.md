# Tic-Tac-Toe-Artificial-Intelligence
A command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game applying minimax algorithm

---

Aside from doing this as a hobby, this project will serve as my introductory experience to artificial intelligence (in which I'm probably not ready for lol).

Regarding the programming language used, I used C because it is currently the most comfortable language for me, plus I'd like to experience coding a relatively large project from scratch :)

I'm not really good at documenting (and englishing!), so I'll leave you with some references that I used which helped me a lot in developing this game.
