# Tic-Tac-Toe Artificial-Intelligence
A command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game applying minimax algorithm

---

Aside from being a hobby, I made this project to serve as my introductory experience to artificial intelligence programming (in which I'm probably not ready for LOL).

Regarding the command-line part, I'm not really used to GUI programming **yet** (I currently only know some basic SDL API functions).

Regarding the programming language used, I used C because it is currently the most comfortable language for me, plus I'd like to experience coding a relatively large project from scratch :)

I'm not really good at documenting (and englishing!), so I'll leave you with some references that I used which helped me a lot in developing this game.
